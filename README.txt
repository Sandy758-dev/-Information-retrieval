Overview: This Python program utilizes the Cranfield Dataset to construct an information retrieval system. The system is specifically built to catalog and search through documents, offering valuable insights into vectorization methods and query processing algorithms.We have used the Scikit-learn library, a powerful open-source machine learning tool for Python, to create an efficient Indexer and Query Processor.

Application Launch:
1. Download the  Cransfield Dataset Zip folder and unzip it
2. Right click on the unzipped folder and select to open this folder on terminal 
4. Download VSCode and use it for coding
3. To Launch the application run the following commands in the terminal.

Python version -3.11.5 
Mac OS
	python3 -m venv .venv or python -m venv .venv
	source .venv/bin/activate
	pip install scikit-learn
	pip install matplotlib
Run the following to execute the output
	python assignment1.py

Windows OS
	python3 -m venv .venv or python -m venv .venv
	cmd
	source .venv\Scripts\activate
	pip install scikit-learn
	if prompted to upgrade your pip3 , upgarde accordingly
	pip install matplotlib
Run the following to execute the output
	python assignment1.py
